# Pacman AI Project

## Overview

Our Pacman AI agent is designed to navigate and play the classic game Pacman, utilizing advanced reinforcement learning techniques to optimize its performance.

## Key Features

1. **Q-Learning Algorithm**: At the core of our AI is a Q-learning algorithm, a model-free reinforcement learning technique that enables the agent to learn optimal actions by interacting with the game environment. Through trial and error, the agent updates its knowledge to maximize rewards.

2. **Tile Coding**: To efficiently manage the large state space of the game, we implemented tile coding. This method discretizes the continuous state space into a finite number of tiles, allowing the AI to store and retrieve states more effectively. Tile coding ensures that the agent can handle the complexity of the game without running into memory or performance issues.

## Technical Details

- **State Representation**: The game states are discretely stored using tile coding, allowing for efficient state-action mapping and better generalization across similar states.
- **Learning Process**: The agent continuously interacts with the game environment, learning from each action it takes. Over time, the Q-learning algorithm adjusts the Q-values, which represent the expected future rewards of taking certain actions in given states.
- **Performance Optimization**: By employing tile coding, our AI can focus on the most relevant aspects of the game, enhancing its decision-making process and overall performance.

## Goals

The primary objective of our Pacman AI project is to create an intelligent agent capable of playing Pacman efficiently and effectively, demonstrating the power of reinforcement learning and tile coding in complex environments.

## Future Work

We aim to further refine the AI's performance by exploring additional machine learning techniques, such as deep Q-networks (DQNs) and other function approximation methods. Our long-term goal is to develop a highly sophisticated AI agent that can adapt to various game scenarios and exhibit advanced strategic behaviors.
